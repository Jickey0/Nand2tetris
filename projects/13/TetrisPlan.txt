heres a written plan for my Tetris remake

Steps:
1. create an API for filling a 10x20 tetris board
2. create either a 2d array or a single 200 mem array for the theoretical tetris board
4. create a array of all tetris pieces
5. randomly pick from a tetris board (also create a random function)
6. Make a function to check if a peice can fall every dt
7. Decide if how many failed fall function calls that must occur for a piece to be placed
8. Create function to check if a row is cleared
9. If a row is cleared award points to the users score
10. create score keeping UI
11. create function to which says if a block can't be spawned the game is over
12. create a piece rotate function
